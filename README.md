A Tetris game which developed by using C++ & DirectX API. The game used DirectDraw to render the graphics, DirectAudio to play sound, and DirectInput to receive gamepad's commands. It supports force feedback and dynamic tempo change.

Although game¡¦s data structure uses two dimension array to represent all blocks on the screen. But my engine moves all blocks by pixel units. So all blocks' moving is smooth.
